    Whether campaigns against climate-change or tax evasion, data analysis enriches organisations with new arguments for their goals. 
    In “Office Magic” we introduce you to handy formulas for simplifying work routines, questioning your findings and visualizing 
    results quickly and critically.

    Tables are the daily companion of project plannings, analyses & research. In “Office Magic” you learn to use practical functions, 
    e.g. for importing tables from websites. Surveys and other data can be analysed and visualized via pivot functions. That saves 
    time but also helps generating powerful arguments for your campaigns.

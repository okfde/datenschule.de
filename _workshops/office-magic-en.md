    Whether campaigning against climate-change or tax evasion, data analysis enriches organisations with new arguments 
    for their goals. In “Office Magic” we introduce handy formulas that simplify your work routines, help to question 
    your findings and visualize results quickly and critically.<br /><br />
    Tables are daily companions of project planning, analyses & research. In “Office Magic” you learn to use practical 
    functions, e.g. for importing lists from websites. Pivot functions help to analyse and visualize surveys and datasets. 
    That saves time but also helps you to formulate better arguments for your campaigns.

    Data Expeditions are quests to map uncharted territory, discover hidden stories and solve unsolved mysteries in the
    Land of Data. In a team you’ll tackle a problem, answer a question or work on a project. We help you to get started
    and it’s up to you to decide where you go.<br /><br />
    You discover hidden stories and solve mysteries in the Land of Data. In a team you investigate datasets and develop
    new ideas for campaigns and find new a approach to a challenge. We accompany you on your way and introduce you to
    the data pipeline, a method for developing data-driven projects. <br /><br />
    Trying things out and working with real data is best to improve your data literacy skills. The two to three days
    Data Expedition gives you the space to approach your ideas with the help of digital tools and methods. That´s how
    you best get to know working with data and how you may even make some new friends along the way.

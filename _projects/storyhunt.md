 ## Storyhunt.de

 <a href="https://storyhunt.de">'The Story Hunt: Uncover the EU'</a> is a programme hosted by the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany's teams of Datenschule, 
 OpenBudgets, and SubsidyStories.eu. Together with journalists, analysts, non-profit organizations, developers and designers, 
 we want to develop and apply the skills needed to hunt stories in financial data.
 
 The Story Hunt is split into two separate parts: a series of Workshops and an Expedition Weekend in Berlin.
 
 The workshops are tailored to aspiring data journalists and non-profit organizations that are interested in improving 
 their data-literacy skills. They are run by our team and by trusted members of the civic tech community in Germany.
 
 They will culminate in the weekend-expedition at end of June, where - together with proven experts - we are going to 
 dive into a massive database of the European Union’s primary financial instrument, the ESIFunds.
 
 During the weekend, we will form interdisciplinary teams that collaboratively work on finding stories, leads, and data 
 analyses around the EU and its money flows. This will offer an ideal opportunity to practice the acquired skills in a 
 supportive environment.

 ## JedeSchule.de

 Education goes far beyond school classes. Potentials, personality and the commitment to society develop mainly outside of the curriculum. However, information about schools, their activities and partnerships are sparely available in Germany.

 With <a href="http://jedeschule.de/">JedeSchule.de</a>, an information and research platform about schools in Germany, we advocate transparency within the educational system and encourage dialogues between different stakeholders working in this field. 
 For pupils, parents, teachers, politicians and other interested parties we give an overview of 30,000 general schools in Germany. For the first time, information about school types, language courses, number of employed teachers, school activities and partner organisations are presented in detail for each federal state. JedeSchule.de is a joint project between BildungsCent e.V. and School of Data Germany.

 ## Cooperation with BildungCent e.V.

 “We provide schools with multifaceted stimuli, forward-setting programmes and the linking-up with extracurricular partners. We allow for good and effective practical experience and pique interest in a new culture of teaching and learning.“

 BildungsCent e.V., founded in 2003, is a German non-governmental organisation (NGO) working in the educational sector. We aim to enhance the teaching and learning culture by fostering new educational approaches including education for sustainable development. Our action-oriented programmes promote students engagement and the implementation of important issues such as climate change, sustainable development, participation and leadership.
 
 We have worked with more than 5.000 schools throughout Germany and realised innovative educational projects in cooperation with the German government as well as with other civil society organisations. Located in Berlin, we are currently running seven different programmes.

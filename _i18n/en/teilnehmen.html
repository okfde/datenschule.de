		Almost every topic can be enriched by using data. To cover a variety of topics, School of Data Germany depends on a diverse community of developers, designers, journalists, scientists and dedicated people who want to conduct workshops with us. Therefore, we always welcome trainers who like to share their knowledge and enthusiasm on technical issues, strategic insights, organisational solutions and would like to get involved in socio-political projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		School of Data Germany wants to contribute to an inclusive, informative and digitally literate society in which data and technologies are understood and deployed in a meaningful and ethical way.<br/>
		We want to:
	<ul class="list-bulletin">
		<li>support projects of non-profit organisations through services and trainings in a data-driven way.</li>
		<li>encourage non-profit organisations to specifically use data and technologies for projects and acquire technical knowledge independently.</li>
		<li>foster the exchange between non-profit organisations and tech-communities.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="box box-margin-top-medium">
	<h2>Skills and responsibilities</h2>
	<p>
		In collaboration with us, trainers conceptualise and moderate speeches, creative events and workshops for beginners, intermediates and experts. Sessions and workshops can range from a lightning talk to workshops lasting several weeks with our partners.
		<br>
		We would like to establish a diverse mixture of workshops representing various areas. You should be able to communicate your (technical) skills in an understandable way. It’s also important to have expertise on your topic, whether it’s ethical aspects of collecting and using data, finding, cleaning, analysing, visualising and communicating knowledge, or how to use data with digital tools and/or how to write beautiful code.

    School of Data provides a nationwide educational program covering topics on data handling and related technologies. We address non-profit organisations that are interested in learning how to use data effectively within their work or
    want to enhance their abilities in processing data. Over the course of three months we develop data-driven projects with our partners. Through our network of trainers we offer tailored workshops and tool trainings which address the
    needs of our partners. </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to:<br>
    <ul class="list-bulletin">
      <li>encourage organisations to use data and technology in their work strategically</li>
      <li>empower non-profit organisations to use digital tools and data as an additional source of information in different fields, such as research, project and organisational development</li>
      <li>empower non-profit organisations to shape public debates based on evidence</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="box-head">Learn how to use data in a meaningful way</h2>
  <p>
    Get to know us and improve your data literacy! Whether you are a novice or an expert in wrangling data, we offer different ways of collaborating with us. See our calendar for our upcoming events.

    <h2>Workshops</h2>
    <p>
      We organise short, hands-on workshops which provide practical insights on various topics related to data. What is open data, how do you find and clean data for further analysis, and how does one create meaningful
      visualisations without having a degree in computer science?

  <h2>Digital, data-driven projects</h2>
  <p>
    Over a period of three months, we support projects and organisations in finding data-driven solutions to their challenges and everyday questions. By combining individual workshops, consultations and technical trainings, we
    try to improve your organisationâ€™s understanding and use of data.
  </p>
  <h3>Here is how it works</h3>
  <ul class="list-bulletin">
    <li>
      <h3>Step 1: Getting to know each other & defining challenges</h3>
      <p>First of all we want to get to know you, your work and your knowledge about data: Where do you use data in your everyday work? What is your data workflow? Where do you need support? Besides that we're interested in your question: Do you want to know how clean the drinkable water in your area is? Or figure out which neighborhoods are affected the most by aircraft noise? Tell us about your challenges that you want to overcome with data!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 2: Find data & formulate project sketch</h3>
      <p>As the next step we start researching together. Do we have to collect data first or are there data sets around your question? If so, are openly accessible or do they need to be freed (e.g. from public registers)? Depending on the baseline we'll design a sketch afterwards that will further concretize the project idea and plan how to proceed. For that we'll use the  <a href="/en/workshops/#data-pipeline">Data Pipeline</a> as orientation - our method of implementing digital projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 3: Individual workshops & trainings</h3>
      <p>To better prepare and evaluate the data, we'll train you data exterpise through workshops and technical trainings that we'll tailor to your needs, and give you a few tools, tipps and tricks that will support your in your daily work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 4: Project implementation</h3>
      <p>Then it's time for the implementation: Together we'll clean, analyze and visualize the data and think about how to best present the results. Depending on the idea or challenge, that could be a new website, a (web-) app or digital map, where your data can be viewed and searched. Maybe you want to start a campaign or put the results on your own website. Do you have more ideas? Do tell us!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Step 5: Document & evaluate</h3>
      <p>After the project has been implemented, we'll evaluate our collaboration together, document the individual steps and learnings and prepare them transparently for interested people. That way we're sharing the gained knowledge with everyone.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
